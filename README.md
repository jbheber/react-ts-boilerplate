# React typescript + RxJs Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn coverage`

Launches the test runner and outputs the tests code coverage.

### `yarn build` or `yarn build.ci`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Project Structure

### `src/components/`

Folder that contains all the UI reusable components.

### `src/hooks/`

Folder that contains all custom hooks. Ex: useI18n.  
Create inside here all custom hooks and export them using the `index.tsx` file.

```ts
export * from './useCustomHook'
```

### `src/pages/`

Folder that contains all react components that represent website pages.  
Structure of a page component:

- Page/
  - ** snapshots **/
  - Page.scss
  - Page.test.tsx
  - index.tsx

`__snapshots__/` folder is auto generated by jest.  
Export the component from the `index.tsx` file

```ts
export default Page
```

### `src/router/`

Contains the component that maps the Pages to routes as well as the routes.  
To add a new page add it's path to the `routes.ts` file and then map the component to the file.

```tsx
<Switch>
  <Route path={paths.PAGE_PATH} component={Page} />
  ...
  <Route path={paths.ROOT} component={Home} />
</Switch>
```

### `src/state/`

#### `src/state/actions/`

This folder contains the actions RxJs and Redux listens to.

```ts
export const ACTION_NAME = createAction('ACTION_NAME')
```

#### `src/state/epics/`

This folder contains RxJs epics that are triggered when their corresponding action is fired.  
Check out [here](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/operator-decision-tree) which operations to use.

1. To add new epics export the folder as an array using the `epics/{new folder}/index.ts`

```ts
import { epic1Epic } from './epic1'
...
import { epicNEpic } from './epicN'

export default [epic1Epic, ..., epicNEpic]
```

2. Import the new epics folder and use the spread operator to add them to the existing ones in `epics/index.ts`

```ts
import global from './global'
import newEpics from './newEpics'

export default combineEpics(...[...global, ...newEpics])
```

#### `src/state/reducers/`

This folder contains all the reducers and the configurations of the redux persist.

Structure:

- reducers/
  - newReducer/
    - index.ts
    - newReducer.test.ts
  - index.ts

Create one folder per reducer. This folder must contain the `index.ts` file that export the reducer and a `{reducerName}.test.ts`  
In the `index.ts` import the new reducer and add it to the `combineReducers` method.  
If you want to have the data of this reducer persisted in the local storage then encapsulate the reducer with `persistReducer`.

### `src/styles/`

This folder contains all extensions of the styles framework.

### `src/testing/`

This folder contains testing utilities.
